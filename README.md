The analysis and visualisations were created using **Power BI**. However, since the client was not familiar with the platform and requested a **PDF file**, the Power BI dashboards were exported as a PDF after completion. This approach influenced design decisions:
- Some text that would normally be placed in tooltips was written in text boxes.
- Interactive filtering was not used, focusing instead on a static design.
